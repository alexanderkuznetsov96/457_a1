If you can't get it to run, you might have to install the appropriate modules:

python -m pip install -U pip <module name>

If you get an error saying the "glutInit" function is undefined, add the appropriate dll's from here:

ftp://ftp.sgi.com/opengl/glut/glutdlls.zip

to <python 2.7>/Lib/site-packages/OpenGL/DLLS (create the folder if it doesn't exist)
